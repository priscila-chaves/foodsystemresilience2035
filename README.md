# UK Food System Resilience 2035

**Technologies, Tensions & Possible Futures**

A fact-checked analysis of technological disruptions shaping UK food system resilience, designed for food & beverage leaders and policymakers.

## Overview

This repository contains research materials and workshop briefs exploring five key technologies that could reshape the UK food system by 2035:

1. **AI & Predictive Systems** — Demand forecasting, yield prediction, supply chain optimisation
2. **Controlled Environment Agriculture** — Vertical farms, climate-proof growing, urban production
3. **Clean Ingredients & Fermentation** — Precision fermentation, novel proteins, functional ingredients
4. **Advanced Manufacturing & Robotics** — Autonomous harvesting, automated processing
5. **Digital Traceability & Blockchain** — Provenance tracking, regulatory compliance

## Key Findings

### Critical Correction
The UK has **not** approved cultivated meat for human consumption. The July 2024 FSA approval was for pet food only. Four companies await human consumption approval.

### Technology Readiness

| Technology | Status | UK Position |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| AI & Predictive Systems | Deploying Now | Strong R&D base |
| Controlled Environment Agriculture | Scaling | Growing investment |
| Clean Ingredients & Fermentation | Emerging | No human food approvals yet |
| Advanced Manufacturing & Robotics | Early Stage | Half EU adoption rate |
| Digital Traceability | Pilots | Major retailers testing |

### UK Statistics
- **71%** of global food execs now use AI (up from 42% in one year)
- **112 vs 224** — UK robots per 10k workers vs EU average (ranked 24th globally)
- **£200M+** — UK biomanufacturing fund + FSA regulatory sandbox launched

## Workshop Materials

The **Landscape Brief** is designed as a creative provocation for futures/scenario planning workshops. It includes:

- Current supply vulnerabilities and consumer signals
- Five technologies with use cases and future implications
- Strategic tensions to navigate (Speed↔Safety, Global↔Local, etc.)
- Four scenario archetypes for pressure-testing
- Discussion prompts for workshop participants
